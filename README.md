The significance and purpose of this multi-objective Combined Heat and Power Economic Emission Dispatch (MO-CHPEED) problem aims to determine the optimal generator output of the co-generation systems, in which two conflicting objectives of the fuel cost and mass of emissions are to be simultaneously minimized. The nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the objective functions needs a good optimization technique to handle it. This paper proposes a Dynamically Controlled Whale Optimization Algorithm (DCWOA) to solve the multi-objective non-convex MO-CHPEED problem in fuzzy environment. The proposed DCWOA is an improved variant of the traditional WOA method by adding dynamically controlled constriction function. Both the conflicting objectives of fuel cost and mass of emissions are handled using Fuzzy Framework. To highlight the performance of the proposed technique, it is tested on the latest CEC test functions and three different MO-CHPEED case studies. The results obtained by proposed DCWOA after 100 independent trails on latest CEC test functions and compared with latest different published methods show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method for getting better average and STD values. Moreover, proposed DCWOA is also tested on different dimensioned MO-CHPEED test functions after 100 independent trails and compared with latest techniques. Again the most compromise.
